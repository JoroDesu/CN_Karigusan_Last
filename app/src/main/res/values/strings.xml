    <string name="sample">\n\n
In the grand halls of Elsinore Castle, a shadowy specter appeared. It was the ghost of King Hamlet, the former ruler of Denmark, beckoning for his son, Prince Hamlet. The apparition revealed a haunting secret - his death was no accident but a murder most foul.
\n\n
Prince Hamlet, tormented by grief and betrayal, swore to avenge his fathers murder. He would feign madness, setting the stage for a chilling tale of deceit and treachery.
\n\n
As the courtiers of the castle watched, Hamlets eccentric behavior became a cause for concern. He questioned the motives of those around him, including his mother, Queen Gertrude, and her new husband, King Claudius, the murderer.
\n\n
Hamlets quest for justice unraveled a web of political intrigue and personal vendettas. He devised a plan to expose Claudius guilt through a play within a play, "The Mousetrap."
\n\n
The performance of "The Mousetrap" exposed Claudius guilt, sending shockwaves through the court. In the ensuing chaos, Hamlet confronted his mother, Gertrude, and unleashed a torrent of pent-up emotions.
\n\n
The tragic climax of "Hamlet" unfolded in the final act, where the fates of Hamlet, Ophelia, Laertes, and Claudius intertwined in a fatal dance of swords, poison, and madness.
\n\n
In the end, the castles halls were filled with death and despair. Hamlets quest for justice had come at a great cost, leaving only the silence of the dead.
\n\n
As the curtain fell on this tale of revenge and tragedy, one question lingered in the minds of those who witnessed it: "To be or not to be?" The legacy of "Hamlet" would endure as a timeless exploration of the human condition.
